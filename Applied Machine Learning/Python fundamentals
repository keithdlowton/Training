--- Parameter functions in trees ---
------------------------------------

max depth: controls the maximum depth or the number of split points the decision can have and it's probably
the most common parameter used to reduce tree complexity and thus reduce overfitting

min samples: leaf parameter is the threshold that controls what the minimum number of data instances has to
be in a leaf to avoid splitting it further. This setting also reduces tree complexity.

max leaf: nodes limits the total number of nodes that are leaves of the tree. In effect, setting this 
parameter will indirectly influence the other two parameters and vice versa. So in practice, adjusting
only one of these trees is typically enough to control most overfitting.
